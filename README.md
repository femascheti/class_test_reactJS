# my first react JS project
I've been finding time to develop some projects using technologies that have interested me for a while. Recently, applying for a job vacancy for Teacher in Information Technology, I developed a project with React JS to present in a 10-minute test class. This project is pretty simple to do and is a great starter project for anyone who would like to use React JS. 

I didn't pass for the job, but the result of the project, I will leave here!
